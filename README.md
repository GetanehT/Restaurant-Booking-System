  ## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users.

* I have used `#ffffff` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `##000000`  as the overlay used over the sites background image.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

 ### Features
*	Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
*	Navigation menu for easy access to different sections.
*	Contact form for user feedback.
* Social media links for better connectivity.

#### The Home Page
* Content
* Home Page (index.html)
Ethiopian Flavors Restaurant Webpage
* The Ethiopian Flavors Restaurant Booking System is a 
  responsive web application designed to provide an intuitive 
  and user-friendly platform for restaurant customers to view 
  the menu, check opening hours, and make reservations. The 
 site features a clean and modern design, with a focus on 
  accessibility and performance across devices.

### Testing 

This section outlines the key testing strategies and approaches used to ensure that the Restaurant Reservation System functions correctly. Testing is crucial to verify that all components of the system are working as expected and provide a seamless user experience.

### Manual Testing

* Manual testing involves the process of manually interacting 
  with the system to ensure all features work as expected.

* Key Areas for Manual Testing:
* Navigation:

* Ensure all links in the navigation bar (Home, Menu, 
   Reservation) direct to the correct pages.
* Verify that the favicon appears properly on different devices 
   and browsers.
* Booking Form:

* Test the form validation for required fields (name, email, 
   phone, date, time, guests, tables).
*  Verify that the date and time pickers function correctly.
   Ensure form submission works, and a success message is 
    displayed.
* Check that the form does not submit with invalid inputs 
  (e.g., missing email, future dates).

* Menu Page:

* Ensure that all food and drink items display correctly with 
  proper pricing.
* Test the accordion functionality to ensure each section 
  (Starter, Main Menu, Cocktails, etc.) expands and collapses.
   Contact Section:

* Verify that contact details (phone, email, address) are 
  visible and correctly formatted.
* Check that the social media links in the footer open the 
   respective pages.

### Functional Testing

* Functional testing checks if the system's features work 
  according to the requirements.

* Key Functional Tests:
* Form Validation:

* Ensure that form fields validate user input correctly (e.g., 
  email format, phone number format, required fields).
* Form Submission:

* Simulate form submission with different input scenarios 
   (e.g., valid data, invalid data, missing fields).
* Ensure that correct error messages are shown for missing or 
  invalid data.
*  Verify successful form submission leads to a confirmation 
   message.
* Dynamic Content Display:

* Test if the "success message" section appears only after a 
  successful booking submission.
  
### Usability Testing

* Usability testing ensures that users can navigate and 
  interact with the system intuitively.

Key Usability Tests:
Ease of Navigation:

* Confirm that the navigation between Home, Menu, and  
   Reservation pages is smooth and intuitive.

* Mobile Responsiveness:

* Test the entire site on different screen sizes (mobile, 
  tablet, desktop) to ensure responsiveness and readability.
  Clarity of Form Instructions:

* Verify that form labels and error messages are clear and easy 
  to understand for users.

### Browser Compatibility Testing
* Testing the application across different web browsers ensures 
  consistent functionality.

* Browsers to Test:
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Safari
* Microsoft Edge
* Opera
* Test each browser to ensure that:

* All styling, layouts, and features (accordion, form) work the 
  same.
    The booking form behaves identically in each browser.
  
### Performance Testing
   
Performance testing evaluates the system's response times and overall performance.

* Key Performance Metrics:
*  Load Time:

* Ensure that pages load quickly, especially the reservation 
    form and menu items.
* Form Submission Speed:

* Test the time it takes from form submission to the 
   appearance of the success message.
   
### Security Testing
Security testing is vital to ensure that the system is protected against vulnerabilities.

*  Key Security Checks:
Form Input Validation:

Ensure no malicious code (e.g., SQL injection) can be entered in the form fields.

* HTTPS Implementation:

Verify that the website uses HTTPS to secure user data, especially on the booking form page.

### Conclusion

The Restaurant Reservation System is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for booking tables and engaging with the restaurant. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please reach out to the restaurant through the provided contact methods. Enjoy your meal!
